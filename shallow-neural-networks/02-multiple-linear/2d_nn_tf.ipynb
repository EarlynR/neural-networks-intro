    "Our multiple linear regression solution with `tensorflow` is going to differ from our `theano` solution (notebook `2c`) in the same way it did for simple linear regression -  `get_tensorflow_graph` will return back the steps necessary to perform forward and backward propagation as multiple pieces, rather than one callable function. Steps `1-5` will still correspond to the forward pass and step `6` the backward pass. Compared to our `tensorflow` implementation for simple linear regression, we see a slight difference in step `6`, which we'll walk through below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the individual pieces being returned: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `betas` variable is returned so that we can view our original coefficient values before any training begins. We can do this by passing our `betas` into `sess.run` before training. Note the generation of `betas` as a [Variable object](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/basic_usage.html#variables) - this is what allows our coefficient values to be updated and shared across iterations. \n",
    "2. `train` holds the magic of our computational graph, and is different from how we solved simple linear regression with `tensorflow`. With simple linear regression, we were explicit about our backward propagation steps, and coded up each individual equation for updating our coefficients. Here, we instead feed the quantity that we want minimized (the **mean squared error**, `E`) to a [tensorflow Optimizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/train.html), which provides us with a simple interface for performing gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    " When we call [minimize](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/train.html#processing-gradients-before-applying-them) on this `Optimizer`, it builds the calculation of the derivatives and the performing of the updates into our computational graph. It by default takes the derivatives of all of the `tf.Variable` objects that it finds in the computational graph prior to that step. Here, this is just `betas`. \n",
    " \n",
    " When `train` is run in a session below, any steps that are necessary to perform the minimization step will be run, which in effect is every step that is part of the forward and backward propagation.\n",
    "3. Finally, `xs` and `ys` are placeholders for our data, and are returned so that we can tell `tensorflow` exactly what part of our graph the real data should line up with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll use one of the `Session` objects we've discussed to perform gradient descent and learn the true values for each beta coefficient in `betas`. "

This [Session object](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/api_docs/python/client.html#session-management) allows us to encapsulate all of the calculations and implementation details of our graph (or any graph) into a single environment. When running multiple graphs, each of which might have their own specialized environment, this is incredibly helpful. \n",

Here, this is just the `betas` variable. Once we have created a `Session` object and initialized all of our variables, we can run parts of our graph or ask for values of variables by passing them into `Session.run`. Any time that we want to view the values held in the `betas` variable, for example, we run:  \n",

To perform these steps, `xs` and `ys` are necessary, and are passed in via the `feed_dict` argument. The keys of the `feed_dict` are the variable names referring to the placeholder objects in the graph, and the values are the data that will be used for those placeholders.
